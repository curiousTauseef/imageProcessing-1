#**Image Processing**

This repository contains image processing algorithms implemented as a   
part of EE 569 - Introduction to Digital image processing at USC.  

The high level overview of algorithms implemented in each folder is   
given below:  

###**HW1:**   
-> Cropping and Resizing  
-> Color Space Transformation  
-> Histogram Equalization using TF and CDF based approach  
-> Image Denoising using Median filter, Mean filter and NLM  

###**HW2**
