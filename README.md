given below:  

####**HW1:**   
* Cropping and Resizing    
* Color Space Transformation    
* Histogram Equalization using TF and CDF based approach  
* Image Denoising using Median filter, Mean filter and NLM  

####**HW2:**
* Geometrical Warping  
* Puzzle Matching 
* Homographic Transformation and Image Overlay
* Digital Halftoning using:    
    * Ordered Dithering
